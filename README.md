# Creating Digital Editions with FairCopy

In this workshop, participants will learn how to use FairCopy to transform historical texts into online digital editions. Using crowdsourced transcriptions as a starting point, we will add semantic structure and mark names of people, places, and events. We will then publish our digital editions using Jekyll.
